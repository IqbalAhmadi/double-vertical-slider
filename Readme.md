# Double Vertical Slider ðŸ”¥

The Double Vertical Slider is a web project that showcases a two-part vertical slider. The left part displays a name, while the right part contains an image and two buttons. When the "Up" button is pressed, the name smoothly drops down, and simultaneously, the image moves up. The same effect applies to both buttons.
